# The Open-Closed Principle states:

 that software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the behavior of a class should be easily extended without modifying its existing code. But in this example whenever we would try to change the logic of the calculate area, we will require to change the class thats why it is not following the OCP.
