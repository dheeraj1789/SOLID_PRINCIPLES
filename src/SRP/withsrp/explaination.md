In this refactored code, we have separated the responsibilities into three separate classes.

The UserManager class now solely focuses on user management operations, the EmailService class handles email-related functionalities, and the UserReportGenerator class is responsible for generating user reports.

By following the SRP, we achieve better code organization, improved maintainability, and increased flexibility. Each class now has a clear and single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and modify in the future.

Remember, adhering to the SRP promotes cleaner, more maintainable code by ensuring that each class or module has a clear and distinct purpose.
