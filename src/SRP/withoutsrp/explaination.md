In this example, the UserManager class violates the SRP because it has multiple responsibilities. It handles user management operations, sending emails to users, and generating user reports. This can lead to several issues:

# H1 Maintenance Complexity: 

    If any of these responsibilities change, it would require modifying the UserManager class, potentially impacting other unrelated parts of the code.

# H1 Readability and Understandability: 

     Developers reading the code might find it difficult to understand the purpose and responsibilities of the UserManager class due to its multiple functionalities.
