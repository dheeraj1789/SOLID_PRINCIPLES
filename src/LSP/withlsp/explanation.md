To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, we should refactor the code:

```
abstract class Shape {
  abstract calculateArea(): number;
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(protected width: number, protected height: number) {
    super();
  }

  setWidth(width: number): void {
    this.width = width;
  }

  setHeight(height: number): void {
    this.height = height;
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Square extends Shape {
  constructor(private sideLength: number) {
    super();
  }

  setSideLength(sideLength: number): void {
    this.sideLength = sideLength;
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return this.sideLength * this.sideLength;
  }
}

```

In this updated example, we have an abstract Shape class and two concrete implementations: Rectangle and Square. Each class correctly maintains its own behavior without violating the LSP. The Rectangle and Square classes now inherit from the common Shape class and implement the calculateArea method specific to their shapes.

Now, if we run the previous usage scenario:

```
function printArea(shape: Shape): void {
  console.log(`Area: ${shape.calculateArea()}`);
}

const rectangle = new Rectangle(6, 3);
const square = new Square(6);

printArea(rectangle); // Output: Area: 18
printArea(square); // Output: Area: 36

```

By adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle, the program behaves correctly regardless of whether we pass a Rectangle or Square object to the `printArea
